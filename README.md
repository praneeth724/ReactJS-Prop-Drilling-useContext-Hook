## Overview

🚀 Excited to share a practical use of React's useContext hook! 🎉

👨‍💻 In this example, I've used the useContext hook to manage the state of a username across multiple components in a React application. This is particularly useful for passing data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

👀 Check out the full example on GitHub: 

💡 Using useContext simplifies the process of managing global state in React, making our code more readable and maintainable.

## Usage

1.Create a Context:
Use the createContext function to create a new context. This will provide a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

2.Provide a Context Value:
Wrap your application or a part of your application where you want to use the context with a Provider component. This Provider component accepts a value prop, which will be the value accessible to consuming components.

3.Consume the Context:
Use the useContext hook in your child components to access the context value.
